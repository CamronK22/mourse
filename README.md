# mourse
stupid simple python script to allow me to use my mouse as a text input in morse code

Usage:

mourse .   → save a dit

mourse -   → save a dah

mourse b   → backspace

mourse s   → type character


Personally, I hook this into Compiz's custom key bindings and set the mouse bindings to each mouse button at the top of the screen.
My scroll buttons control dits and dahs and use left and right clicks as send and backspace respectively.

As far as I know this only works on Linux but you can easily modify the code to be compatible with your filesystem.
